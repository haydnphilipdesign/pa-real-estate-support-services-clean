# Text Color Adjustment Implementation

## Overview

This document explains the changes made to improve text readability throughout the site by adjusting the default text color for paragraph, span, and list elements from gray-700 to a darker gray-800 shade.

## Background

The original design used Tailwind's gray-700 color (rgb(55, 65, 81)) for text elements such as paragraphs, spans, and list items. While this color does provide sufficient contrast against white backgrounds (about 10:1 ratio, well above the WCAG AA standard of 4.5:1), stakeholder feedback indicated a preference for slightly darker text for better readability.

## Changes Made

1. **Created a new CSS file**: `text-color-adjustment.css` that targets specific text elements
2. **Updated the default text color**: Changed from gray-700 to gray-800 (#1f2937) for better readability
3. **Added context-specific overrides**: Maintained proper contrast for text on colored backgrounds
4. **Implemented the changes non-destructively**: Original styles remain but are now commented out

## Technical Implementation

The new text color is implemented by:

```css
p, span, li {
  color: #1f2937 !important; /* gray-800 - darker and more readable */
}
```

Special cases are handled appropriately to maintain contrast:
- Dark backgrounds (blue, navy, etc.) - white text
- Gold/amber backgrounds - navy text
- Hero sections - very light text with shadow
- Footer areas - light gray text

## Testing Recommendations

Please verify these changes by checking:
1. Regular paragraph text on white backgrounds (should be darker now)
2. Text within colored cards (should maintain proper contrast)
3. Text in hero sections (should remain highly visible)
4. List items in navigation and content areas

## WCAG Compliance

The new color maintains excellent contrast ratios:
- Gray-800 on white: ~16:1 (exceeds WCAG AAA requirement of 7:1)
- White on dark backgrounds: ~16+:1
- Navy on gold: ~9:1

## Future Considerations

If additional text color adjustments are needed:
1. Edit the `text-color-adjustment.css` file
2. Test thoroughly against all background contexts
3. Document any changes in this file

## Reverting Changes

If needed, this change can be reverted by:
1. Removing the import of `text-color-adjustment.css` from index.css
2. Uncommenting the original text color definition in index.css
