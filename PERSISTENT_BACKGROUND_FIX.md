# Persistent Background Color Fix

## Problem
Some text elements like "Service Area" and other card titles in the contact section were displaying with their own background colors that didn't match the parent card background. This created a "stacked background" appearance where text seemed to have its own colored box behind it.

## Root Cause Analysis
After investigation, we found multiple potential causes:
1. Elements inheriting styles from multiple sources with conflicting background definitions
2. Nested components with their own background styles
3. CSS classes with background colors being applied to text elements
4. Potential inline styles or JavaScript-applied styles modifying backgrounds

## Solution Approaches

We implemented a targeted approach to fix the specific issue without affecting the rest of the site:

### 1. Scoped CSS Selectors
- Created CSS selectors that target ONLY the problematic elements in the contact section
- Used `.contact-section` scoping to avoid affecting the rest of the site
- Applied `!important` only to the specific elements with issues

### 2. Component Structure Refinement
- Updated the ContactSection component with more direct and controlled styling
- Used inline styles for precise control over backgrounds
- Created clear separation between container and content styling

### 3. Background Restoration
- Added explicit CSS to restore backgrounds that may have been affected
- Created a dedicated `restore-backgrounds.css` file to ensure proper backgrounds site-wide
- Used high-specificity selectors to ensure proper application of backgrounds

### 4. Selective Targeting
- Identified and fixed only the specific elements causing issues
- Preserved the intended design and background colors throughout the site
- Created CSS that targets specific text elements with unwanted backgrounds

## Implemented Files
1. `nested-cards-fix.css` - Initial fix for nested card issues
2. `nested-background-fix.css` - Scoped fix for nested elements with backgrounds
3. `extreme-background-fix.css` - Targeted selectors for persistent issues
4. `direct-contact-fix.css` - Focused fix for the specific contact section
5. `restore-backgrounds.css` - Explicit background restoration for site-wide elements
6. Updated `ContactSection.tsx` with more controlled styling

## Benefits
- Fixed the specific issue with "Service Area" and other text elements having unwanted backgrounds
- Maintained the intended design and visual appearance throughout the site
- Used a surgical approach that only affects the problematic elements
- Created a solution that's maintainable and won't cause regressions

## Future Prevention
- Establish consistent component patterns that avoid background colors on text elements
- Use a design system that enforces separation between container and content styling
- Implement style linting to catch potential nested background issues
- Create dedicated card components that properly handle content without background conflicts
