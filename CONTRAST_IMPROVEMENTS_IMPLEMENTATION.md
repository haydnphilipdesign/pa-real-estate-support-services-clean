## Best Practices Implemented

## Testing Recommendations

To ensure the changes meet WCAG AA standards, the following testing is recommended:

1. Verify all text has at least 4.5:1 contrast ratio using tools like:
   - WebAIM Contrast Checker
   - Lighthouse Accessibility audits
   - WAVE accessibility evaluation tool

2. Test with different user scenarios:
   - Users with low vision
   - Color blind users
   - Users with screen readers
   - Mobile device users

## Future Maintenance Guidelines

1. **Maintain Color Discipline:**
   - Always use the contrast-variables.css for color definitions
   - Follow the "dark text on light backgrounds, light text on dark backgrounds" rule
   - Never use gold/amber text on white or light backgrounds
   - Use navy text on gold/amber backgrounds

2. **Component Guidelines:**
   - For glass cards: match text color to background tone (light on dark, dark on light)
   - For buttons: ensure text has high contrast against button background
   - For links: avoid gold color for hover states on light backgrounds
   - For hero sections: maintain dark overlays with contrasting text

3. **Ongoing Testing:**
   - Regularly audit the site with accessibility tools
   - Conduct user testing with various accessibility needs
   - Check contrast whenever adding new components or styles

These improvements ensure that the PA Real Estate Support Services website meets accessibility standards while maintaining its brand identity and visual appeal.
