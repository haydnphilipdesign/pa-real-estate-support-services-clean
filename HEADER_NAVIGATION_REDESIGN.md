## Key Features

### 1. Adaptive Navigation

- **Context-Aware Styling**: The header adapts its appearance based on scroll position and current page
- **Transparent to Solid Transition**: Starts transparent and transitions to a solid background with shadow when scrolled
- **Smart Hide/Show**: Automatically hides when scrolling down and reveals when scrolling up

### 2. Improved Components

- **Contact Information Bar**: A top bar displays contact information when scrolled or on the Agent Portal

### 3. Mobile Optimizations

- **Animated Transitions**: Smooth animations for menu open/close actions
- **Contact Information**: Mobile menu includes phone and email contact information

### 4. Technical Improvements
