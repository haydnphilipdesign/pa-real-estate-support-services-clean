## Documentation Boilerplate Workflow

**Objective:**  
Maintain clear and up-to-date documentation by generating or updating the project README.

### Rules:
1. Start with a one-sentence project summary at the very top.
2. Include sections for:
   - Overview
   - Installation steps
   - Usage instructions
   - Example code
   - Contribution guidelines (if applicable)
   - License (if applicable)
3. Keep documentation concise, well-formatted, and easy to understand.
4. If a section is missing information, add a placeholder and prompt for user input.

### Output:
- Full or updated README.md file.
- One-sentence summary of what was updated/added.

**Example summary:**  
> Added install and usage steps to README, included code sample, and summarized project at the top.
