# Nested Card Background Fix

## Problem
Throughout the website, there were instances of card components with their own background colors being nested within other cards, causing visual inconsistencies. Cards within cards were showing their background colors, creating a "card-on-card" appearance rather than properly inheriting from their parent.

## Solution
This fix addresses nested card background issues across the site by:

1. **Enhanced CSS Selectors**: Added comprehensive selectors to target all card variants nested within any other card variant
2. **Background Transparency**: Forces nested cards to have transparent backgrounds while preserving text styling
3. **Removal of Redundant Effects**: Disables backdrop filters, borders, and shadows on nested cards
4. **Improved Text Inheritance**: Ensures text colors properly inherit from parent cards
5. **Component-Level Fixes**: Modified specific components (AboutSection and ServicesOverview) to use better nesting practices

## Implementation
The fix includes:

1. Updated `card-fixes.css` with more comprehensive selectors
2. Created new `nested-cards-fix.css` with additional fixes
3. Modified component structure in AboutSection.tsx and ServicesOverview.tsx 
4. Added CSS import to index.css
5. Created batch script for easy application of the fix

## Benefits
- Consistent visual appearance throughout the site
- Improved text readability on cards
- Elimination of "stacked background" effect
- Better maintenance of the design system

## Future Recommendations
- Use composition rather than nesting for complex card layouts
- Maintain a clear hierarchy of UI components
- Test cards on various background colors before implementation
