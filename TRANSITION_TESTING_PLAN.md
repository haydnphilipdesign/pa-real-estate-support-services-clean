# Page Transition Testing Plan

## Overview
This testing plan outlines a structured approach to validate the smoothness and consistency of page transitions across the entire site. After implementing animation improvements and anti-flicker measures, it's crucial to verify that these changes work correctly across all routes and use cases.

## Test Environment Requirements
- Test in multiple browsers: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge
- Test on multiple devices: Desktop, Tablet, Mobile
- Test at various network speeds: Fast, Medium, Slow
- Test with and without hardware acceleration enabled

## Core Test Scenarios

### 1. Basic Navigation Transitions
- Home page to About page
- About page to Services page
- Services page to Work With Me page
- Any page to Privacy/Terms pages
- Navigation back to Home from any page

**Expected Result:** Smooth transition with background persisting, hero content fading appropriately, and no visual glitches or flickering.

### 2. Specialized Routes
- Standard page to Agent Portal / Login
- Login to Transaction Form
- Transaction Form back to main site
- Design System and Glass Cards showcase pages

**Expected Result:** Appropriate transition style based on route type, with agent portal having faster transitions and transaction form having clean entry/exit.

### 3. Rapid Multi-Page Navigation
- Quick navigation through multiple pages in sequence
- Use browser back/forward buttons rapidly
- Test history navigation (go back 2-3 pages at once)

**Expected Result:** All transitions should complete properly, no stuck or incomplete animations, and background slideshow should maintain correct state.

### 4. Edge Cases
- Refresh page during transition
- Navigate away during transition
- Navigate to external link and return
- Open in new tab and compare states

**Expected Result:** Graceful handling of interruptions, proper state restoration, and consistent experience when returning to the site.

## Specific Transition Elements to Validate

### Background Slideshow
- Slideshow continues seamlessly across page changes
- No image "jumps" or flickering during transitions
- Ken Burns effects maintain consistency
- Slideshow timing is not disrupted by page changes

### Hero Components
- Hero title/subtitle smoothly transitions between pages
- No content flashes or disappears prematurely
- Staggered animations play correctly on entry
- Exit animations complete properly

### Z-Index and Stacking
- All elements maintain proper stacking order during transitions
- No elements incorrectly appear above/below others
- Persistent elements (headers, background) stay in correct position

### Timing and Coordination
- Entry and exit animations are properly coordinated
- No "double animations" where both pages animate simultaneously
- Consistent timing across different page types

## Validation Methods

### Visual Inspection
- Observe transitions at normal and slow-motion speeds (using browser dev tools)
- Record screen during transitions for frame-by-frame analysis if needed
- Look for any flickering, content jumps, or white flashes

### Console Monitoring
- Monitor browser console for any errors or warnings during transitions
- Check for layout thrashing or performance warnings
- Verify no unexpected errors in animation libraries

### Performance Analysis
- Use browser Performance tab to analyze transition performance
- Check for dropped frames during transitions
- Monitor memory and CPU usage during rapid navigation

### Browser Dev Tools
- Use Rendering panel to highlight repaints during transitions
- Use Layers panel to verify proper layer composition
- Check paint flashing to identify unnecessary repaints

## Common Issues to Watch For

1. **White Flashes:** Brief white screen between transitions
2. **Content Jumps:** Elements shifting position unexpectedly
3. **Z-Index Conflicts:** Elements appearing in incorrect stacking order
4. **Timing Mismatches:** Exit animations completing before entry animations begin
5. **Background Flicker:** Background slideshow showing flicker or jumping
6. **Opacity Glitches:** Elements fading in/out incorrectly
7. **Transform Issues:** Elements not properly GPU accelerated
8. **Layout Shifts:** Content repositioning after animation completes
9. **Memory Leaks:** Performance degradation after multiple transitions
10. **State Loss:** Components losing state between transitions

## Regression Testing
After fixes are applied, perform regression testing to ensure no new issues have been introduced:

1. Test all main user flows
2. Verify page content displays correctly
3. Check all interactive elements function properly
4. Ensure accessibility features are maintained
5. Verify SEO elements persist correctly

## Documentation
Document any issues found with:
- Route where issue occurs
- Steps to reproduce
- Browser/device information
- Screenshots or screen recordings
- Console errors (if any)

## Sign-off Criteria
Transitions will be considered successfully fixed when:
- All transitions are smooth with no visible flickering
- Background slideshow maintains seamless state across pages
- No white flashes occur during any transition
- All hero content animates in/out appropriately
- Performance remains optimal even during rapid navigation
- All test scenarios pass across specified browser/device combinations

## Test Automation Recommendations
Consider creating automated visual regression tests using:
- Cypress with cypress-visual-regression
- Playwright with visual comparison
- Selenium with screenshot comparison

These tools can help identify visual regressions in transitions during future development.
