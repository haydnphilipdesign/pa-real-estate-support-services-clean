# Contact Card Contrast Fix

## Problem
The contact section cards had text that was difficult to read against the blue background. Specifically:
- Card titles in dark blue didn't have sufficient contrast with the background
- Contact information was not prominent enough
- Subtexts had low visibility with reduced opacity

## Solution
This fix improves the readability of contact cards by:

1. **Enhanced Card Styling**:
   - Lighter blue background with better transparency
   - Prominent gold top border
   - Improved shadow for depth

2. **Text Contrast Improvements**:
   - Gold card titles for maximum visibility
   - Pure white contact information with increased font weight
   - Increased opacity of subtexts
   - Gold icons for better recognition

3. **Interaction Improvements**:
   - Gold hover state for links
   - Subtle hover animation for the entire card
   - Underline effect on hover for links

## Implementation
The fix includes:

1. Created `contact-cards-fix.css` with targeted styling for contact cards
2. Added the `contact-section` class to the section for scoped styling
3. Updated ContactSection.tsx component with improved styling classes
4. Enhanced icon and text styling for better visibility

## Benefits
- Much better readability of contact information
- Visual consistency with the site's color scheme
- Improved accessibility through better contrast ratios
- Enhanced user experience with clearer interactive elements

## Future Recommendations
- Maintain a minimum contrast ratio of 4.5:1 for text
- Consider using a dedicated contact card component for reusability
- Implement ARIA attributes for better accessibility
