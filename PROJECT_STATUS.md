## 🎯 Work Completed Today

### 1. Content Restoration (✅ COMPLETE)
**Problem:** Page content was missing/incomplete across the website.

**Solution:** Located and restored all existing content from component files.

**Pages Updated:**
- **Home.tsx** - Added AboutSection, Services, Testimonials, FAQ, ContactSection
- **AboutUs.tsx** - Enhanced with Timeline, ProfessionalJourney components  
- **Privacy.tsx** - Added complete privacy policy content
- **Terms.tsx** - Added comprehensive terms of service content
- **Services.tsx** - Already had good content, left unchanged

**Content Sources Found:**
- Rich testimonials in `src/components/Testimonials.tsx` (5 real client reviews)
- Professional timeline in `src/components/Timeline.tsx` (1984-present career history)
- Comprehensive services in `src/components/Services.tsx`
- FAQ content in `src/components/FAQ.tsx`
- Legal content from `src/components/TransactionForm/TermsDialog.tsx`

### 2. Transaction Form Redesign (✅ COMPLETE)
**Problem:** Transaction form looked inconsistent with professional website design.

**Root Cause Analysis:**
- Multiple conflicting CSS files with high specificity
- Over-engineered styling with excessive `!important` declarations
- Different color scheme (blue backgrounds with white text vs. light glass cards)
- Typography inconsistencies
- CSS methodology conflicts (Tailwind vs custom CSS)

**Solution Created:**
- **New Clean CSS:** `src/styles/transaction-form-clean.css` - Aligned with main website
- **Wrapper Component:** `src/components/TransactionForm/TransactionFormWrapper.tsx`
- **Section Component:** `src/components/TransactionForm/FormSection.tsx`
- **Clean Portal:** `src/components/TransactionForm/CleanPortalTransactionForm.tsx`
- **Example Component:** `src/components/TransactionForm/CleanRoleSelection.tsx`

**Design Principles Applied:**
- Consistent glass cards (white/85% opacity backgrounds)
- Professional blue accent color (#0066CC)
- Dark text on light backgrounds throughout
- Same typography hierarchy as main website
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Reduced CSS specificity conflicts

### 3. Technical Fixes (✅ COMPLETE)
- **Phone Number:** Updated to correct (570) 588-4637
- **Dependencies:** Installed missing `react-chrono` for Timeline component
- **Build Issues:** Resolved import errors, build now passes
- **CLAUDE.md:** Created comprehensive guide for future development

## 🏗️ Project Architecture

backdrop-filter: blur(16px);
border: 1px solid rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.2);
color: #1F2937; /* Dark text */
```

### Key Components
- **Hero Components:** Consistent across all pages
- **Glass Cards:** Light backgrounds with dark text
- **Brand Colors:** 
  - Primary Blue: #0066CC
  - Navy: #0F1C2E

## 🚨 Important Notes

### CSS Management
- **Do NOT use:** `transaction-form-complete.css` (conflicts with new design)
- **Use:** `transaction-form-clean.css` for form styling
- **Pattern:** Always use light backgrounds with dark text for consistency

### Component Pattern
When updating form components, follow this pattern:
```tsx
import { FormSection } from './FormSection';

export const YourComponent = () => (
  <FormSection 
    title="Section Title"
    description="Optional description"
    icon={SomeIcon}
  >
    {/* Your form content */}
  </FormSection>
);
```
