# Footer Responsive Layout Fixes

## Overview

This document outlines the changes made to improve the footer layout, specifically addressing issues with text wrapping in the contact information section.

## Issues Fixed

1. **Email Address Wrapping**: The email address was breaking and overflowing on smaller screens
2. **Office Hours Wrapping**: The office hours text wasn't wrapping properly on smaller screens
3. **Column Spacing**: Footer columns needed better spacing on different device sizes

## Implementation Details

### 1. CSS Changes

Created a new dedicated CSS file `footer-responsive.css` with the following improvements:

- Added proper flex structure for contact items
- Applied appropriate `word-break` and `overflow-wrap` properties to ensure text wraps correctly
- Implemented responsive grid layouts with appropriate spacing at different breakpoints
- Created specific CSS classes for footer elements to ensure consistent styling

### 2. Component Changes

Updated the Footer.tsx component with:

- New CSS classes for better structure and styling
- Improved semantic markup for better accessibility
- Responsive column layout with appropriate spacing
- Dedicated classes for contact information items

### 3. Integration

- Added the new CSS file to the main index.css imports
- Ensured compatibility with existing contrast improvements
- Maintained all existing functionality while improving layout

## Technical Details

### Key CSS Classes

```css
.footer-contact-item {
  display: flex;
  align-items: flex-start;
}

.footer-contact-item-icon {
  flex-shrink: 0;
  margin-top: 0.125rem;
  margin-right: 0.75rem;
}

.footer-contact-item-text {
  word-break: break-word;
  overflow-wrap: break-word;
  max-width: 100%;
  display: inline-block;
}

.footer-contact-email {
  word-break: break-word !important;
  overflow-wrap: break-word !important;
  white-space: normal !important;
  display: inline-block;
  max-width: 100%;
}
```

### Responsive Breakpoints

- Mobile (<768px): Single column layout
- Tablet (768px-1023px): Three columns with reduced spacing
- Desktop (>1024px): Three columns with generous spacing

## Testing Notes

These changes were tested across multiple screen sizes to ensure:

1. Email address properly wraps and doesn't overflow
2. Office hours text wraps appropriately
3. Column spacing is visually balanced at all screen sizes
4. All elements maintain proper alignment and contrast

## Future Improvements

If further refinements are needed, consider:

1. Adding max-width constraints to the footer columns
2. Further adjusting spacing for ultra-wide displays
3. Creating a condensed mobile footer variant for very small screens
