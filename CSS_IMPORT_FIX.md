# CSS Import Fix

## Problem

The application was experiencing errors with CSS imports using relative paths. For example:

```
[plugin:vite:import-analysis] Failed to resolve import "./index.css" from "src/components/ServicesOverview.tsx". Does the file exist?
```

This happens because components are trying to import `index.css` from their local directory (`./index.css`) when the file actually exists in the project root (`src/index.css`).

## Solution

We've created a centralized CSS import helper that properly resolves the paths:

1. Created a `FixedCssImport.js` file in the components directory that correctly imports the main CSS
2. Modified components to use this helper instead of direct imports
3. Created a batch script `fix-css-imports.bat` to automate fixing this issue across the codebase

## How to use

### For manual fixes:

Instead of:
```javascript
import './index.css';
```

Use:
```javascript
import { ensureCssImported } from './FixedCssImport'; // or correct relative path
ensureCssImported();
```

### To fix all imports automatically:

Run the batch script:
```
.\fix-css-imports.bat
```

This will scan the codebase and fix all problematic imports.

## For new components

When creating new components, avoid direct imports to CSS files. Instead, use the centralized import helper:

```javascript
import { ensureCssImported } from '../components/FixedCssImport'; // adjust path as needed
ensureCssImported();
```

This approach ensures consistent CSS loading and prevents path resolution issues regardless of where your components are located in the project structure.
