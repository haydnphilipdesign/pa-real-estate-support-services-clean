# Section Background Colors Fix

## Overview

This fix adds back background colors to regular content sections while ensuring specialized sections like heroes, login areas, and transaction forms maintain their existing styling.

## Problem Solved

Previously, our CSS changes removed background colors from all sections, which made the site look too flat and reduced visual distinction between different content areas. This fix specifically targets regular content sections to add appropriate background colors without affecting specialized sections.

## Changes Made

1. Created a new CSS file `regular-section-backgrounds.css` that:
   - Applies light gray (#f9fafb) backgrounds to regular sections
   - Alternates white (#ffffff) backgrounds for every other regular section
   - Applies specific background colors to feature, statistics, testimonial, and contact sections
   - Ensures all section backgrounds extend fully with proper margins and padding

2. Updated import order in the CSS files to ensure proper application of styles

## How to Apply

### Windows Users
Run the `apply-section-backgrounds.bat` script by double-clicking it in File Explorer.

### Mac/Linux Users
Run the `apply-section-backgrounds.sh` script with:
```bash
# Make it executable first (one-time only)
chmod +x apply-section-backgrounds.sh

# Run the script
./apply-section-backgrounds.sh
```

## Visual Impact

- Regular content sections now alternate between medium gray (#e5e7eb) and light gray (#f3f4f6) backgrounds
- Features section has a darker gray background (#d1d5db)
- Testimonial sections have a medium blue background (#dbeafe)
- Statistics sections have a medium gray background (#e5e7eb)
- Enhanced visual separation between sections with stronger contrast
- Hero sections, login forms, and transaction forms remain unchanged

## Browser Compatibility

These changes are compatible with all modern browsers including:
- Chrome 80+
- Firefox 75+
- Safari 13.1+
- Edge 80+

## Future Considerations

If additional section types need special background treatment, they can be added to the `regular-section-backgrounds.css` file with appropriate selectors.
